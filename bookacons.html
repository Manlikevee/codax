Each product has a name, description, price, image, and a button to add it to the cart. You also want to display reviews for each product.  What is the most semantically correct way to structure each product listing, considering accessibility and SEO best practices?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Use <div> for the entire product listing, then nested <div> elements for name, description, price, image, and button. Use a separate <div> for reviews.\",\n      \"Use <article> for the product listing, <header> for name and image, <section> for description and price, <aside> for reviews, and a <button> element for adding to the cart.\",\n      \"Use <section> for the product listing, <header> for name and image, <p> for description and price, <aside> for reviews, and a <button> element for adding to the cart.\",\n      \"Use <section> for the product listing, <header> for name and image, <p> for description, <div> for price, <img> for image, <aside> for reviews, and a <button> element for adding to the cart.\"\n    ],\n    \"answerIndex\": 1,\n    \"explanation\": \"The most semantically correct structure is to use <article> for the product listing, as it represents a self-contained, independent piece of content.  <header> is appropriate for the name and image, <section> for the description and price, <aside> for reviews, and <button> for the add-to-cart functionality. This structure provides clear semantic meaning for assistive technologies like screen readers and search engines.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"topic\": \"HTML Semantics and Best Practices\",\n    \"question\": \"You're developing a web page that contains a blog post, comments, and related content.  You want to structure the content in a way that improves accessibility and SEO. Which HTML elements should you prioritize for this structure?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Use <div> for the main content area, <section> for the blog post, <article> for each comment, and <aside> for related content.\",\n      \"Use <main> for the main content, <article> for the blog post, <section> for comments, and <aside> for related content.\",\n      \"Use <article> for the blog post, <div> for the comments, and <section> for related content.\",\n      \"Use <section> for the entire page, <article> for the blog post and each comment, and <aside> for related content.\"\n    ],\n    \"answerIndex\": 2,\n    \"explanation\": \"The correct structure is to use <article> for the blog post, <div> for the comments (since comments are not self-contained pieces of content), and <section> for related content.  This structure clearly indicates the main content and provides a logical grouping for the various elements on the page.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"topic\": \"HTML Semantics and Best Practices\",\n    \"question\": \"You're designing a page that displays a list of upcoming events. Each event has a title, date, location, and a link to more information. You want to optimize for accessibility and SEO.  Which combination of HTML elements best suits this scenario?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Use <div> for the event list, <ul> for the events, and <li> for each event.

Each <fieldset> should have a <legend> to provide a clear label. Then, use <label> for each individual field and <input> elements for name, email, and checkbox.  This structure provides a logical grouping and clear labeling for the form, improving accessibility and user experience.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"topic\": \"HTML Semantics and Best Practices\",\n    \"question\": \"You're building a website for a restaurant, and you want to include a menu section with dishes categorized into appetizers, main courses, and desserts.
